ReVolt Xbox source code

This is the Xbox ReVolt source code, which also happens to include the PC source code since it depends on a few files from that.
I tried getting it to compile myself, but I got stuck with a ton of EFFECT errors. I was able to get the missing sound header files to generate, but it still
wouldn't compile due to the EFFECT errors, so after a while I gave up and decided to post this here in case anybody wants to take a jab at this. If you get it
to compile, tell me, I have a little bet going on in a friend circle :p
